# Customizing Profile and Image Files (2025-05-28 14:45:23)

_**User**_

Go through everything I want to cusotmize it as accoridng to my profile and images,what all files needs to be change

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you identify the files that need to be customized for your profile. Let me first check the structure of your project to locate the relevant files.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **23** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `.specstory` |
| 📄 `.cursorindexingignore` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📄 `git_data_fetcher.mjs` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📄 `package-lock.json` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📁 `src` |
| 📁 `public` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `.prettierignore` |
| 📄 `.prettierrc.json` |
| 📄 `CNAME` |
| 📄 `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` |

| 📄 `docker-compose.yaml` |
| 📄 `env.example` |
| 📁 `images` |
| 📄 `.all-contributorsrc` |
| 📁 `.github` |

</details>

---

Let me check the src directory where most of the customization files are likely to be located.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src • **15** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `portfolio.js` |
| 📁 `pages` |

| 📄 `logo.svg` |
| 📁 `assets` |
| 📄 `App.css` |
| 📄 `App.js` |
| 📄 `App.test.js` |

</details>

---

Let me check the portfolio.js file since it's likely to contain most of the personal information and customization options.

---

Read file: src/portfolio.js

---

Based on my analysis, here are the main files you'll need to customize for your profile:

1. `src/portfolio.js` - This is the main configuration file where you'll need to update:

   - Personal information (name, title, subtitle)
   - Social media links
   - Skills and expertise
   - Projects
   - Education details
   - Work experience
   - Contact information

2. `src/theme.js` - For customizing the color scheme and theme of your portfolio

3. `public/` directory - For your personal images:

   - Profile picture
   - Project screenshots
   - Any other images you want to use

4. `src/assets/` directory - For additional assets like logos and icons

Let me check the theme.js file to show you the customization options:

---

Read file: src/theme.js

---

Here's a detailed breakdown of what you need to customize:

1. **Personal Information** (`src/portfolio.js`):

   - Update the `greeting` object with your:
     - Name
     - Nickname
     - Subtitle
     - Resume link
     - GitHub profile
   - Update the `seo` object with your:
     - Title
     - Description
     - Website URL
   - Update `socialMediaLinks` with your social media profiles
   - Update `skills` with your expertise
   - Update `educationInfo` with your educational background
   - Update `workExperiences` with your work history
   - Update `projects` with your portfolio projects

2. **Theme Customization** (`src/theme.js`):

   - Choose from available themes:
     - blueTheme
     - brownTheme
     - purpleTheme
     - greenTheme
     - redTheme
     - blackTheme
     - pinkTheme
     - violetTheme
     - tealTheme
     - orangeTheme
     - yellowTheme
     - materialDarkTheme
     - materialLightTheme
     - materialTealTheme
   - Or create your own custom theme by modifying the color values

3. **Images and Assets**:

   - Add your profile picture to the `public/` directory
   - Add project screenshots and images
   - Update any logos or icons in `src/assets/`

4. **Additional Customization**:
   - Update the splash screen settings in `settings` object
   - Customize the contact form information
   - Update the blog section if you have one
   - Modify the talks section if applicable

Would you like me to help you customize any specific section? I can guide you through the process of updating any of these areas with your personal information.

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:

```
A module cannot have multiple default exports.
```

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue - there are multiple `export default` statements in the file. Let me fix this by removing the individual default exports and keeping only the named exports at the end.

```

---

I've removed the individual `export default` statements for `skills` and `experience`, keeping only the named exports at the end of the file. This should resolve the "multiple default exports" error. The file now exports all objects through a single named export statement at the end.

When importing these objects in other files, you'll need to use named imports like:

```javascript
import { skills, experience } from "./portfolio";
```

I've updated the experience section with your data and fixed the export structure. The changes include:

1. Updated the experience object with your work history, open source contributions, and volunteerships
2. Removed the individual `export default experience` statement
3. Kept the named export in the final export statement at the end of the file

The file should now work correctly without any export-related errors. When importing the experience object in other files, you'll need to use:

```javascript
import { experience } from "./portfolio";
```

Let me check the routing and navigation setup to fix this issue. First, I'll look for the relevant components and routing configuration.
