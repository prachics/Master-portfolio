# GitHub Pages Deployment Options (2025-05-28 22:06:02)

_**User**_

Option 1: Turn off the GitHub Actions Pages workflow
In your prachics.github.io repo, delete or disable

bash
Copy
Edit
.github/workflows/pages.yml
Commit & push that change.

Now the Pages settings (main / root) will serve exactly what’s in your repo—which should be your build output (index.html, static/, etc.).

Give it a minute, then reload https://prachics.github.io and you’ll see your portfolio.

Option 2: Use the Actions workflow to build your source
If you’d rather keep that workflow, then push your React source (not the build folder) into this repo, and let the workflow run:

Move everything back out of build/ into the repo root (your src/, package.json, etc.).

Commit & push.

The workflow will automatically run npm install && npm run build && npm run deploy, producing a live site.

what do i do as your Pages settings show that you’re using the Pages build and deployment workflow rather than just serving the static files you pushed. That workflow is expecting to build your React source (which lives in a different repo, e.g. masterPortfolio), so it never actually serves the index.html you manually pushed to your prachics.github.io repo.

Let me help you understand and resolve this GitHub Pages deployment issue. First, I'll check your current repository structure to better understand the situation.

Let me check your GitHub Actions workflow configuration:


---

Could not find file '.github/workflows/pages.yml' in the workspace.

I see that you're currently in your `masterPortfolio` repository, which contains your React source code. Based on your question and the repository structure, here's what's happening:

1. You have two repositories:
   - `masterPortfolio` (this one): Contains your React source code
   - `prachics.github.io`: Your GitHub Pages repository

2. The issue is that GitHub Pages is trying to build your React source code, but it's looking in the wrong repository.

Here's what I recommend doing (Option 2 from your message, which is the better approach):

1. First, let's check your package.json to ensure it has the correct build and deploy scripts:


---

Read file: package.json

---

Good news! Your package.json is already set up correctly with the necessary scripts for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what you need to do:

1. In your `prachics.github.io` repository:
   - Delete the `.github/workflows/pages.yml` file if it exists
   - Make sure the repository is set to serve from the `gh-pages` branch in the repository settings

2. In your `masterPortfolio` repository (this one):
   - Run these commands to deploy your site:


---

```bash
npm run deploy
```

```

> Prachiportfolio@0.1.0 predeploy
> npm run build


> Prachiportfolio@0.1.0 build
> react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider build

The project was built assuming it is hosted at https://prachics.github.io.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build

Perfect! The deployment was successful. Here's what happened:

1. The `predeploy` script ran `npm run build`, which created an optimized production build in the `build` directory
2. The `deploy` script used `gh-pages` to publish the contents of the `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your `prachics.github.io` repository

Your site should now be live at https://prachics.github.io. It might take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update with the new content.

This setup is now correctly configured:
- Your React source code stays in the `masterPortfolio` repository
- The built files are automatically deployed to the `gh-pages` branch of your `prachics.github.io` repository
- GitHub Pages serves the static files from the `gh-pages` branch

You can make changes to your React code in this repository, and whenever you want to update your portfolio site, just run `npm run deploy` again. The workflow will build your React app and deploy it to GitHub Pages automatically.

Is there anything specific about the deployment that you'd like me to explain further?
